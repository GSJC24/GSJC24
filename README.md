👋 Hi, I’m Gerhard S.J. Coetzee
🎯 Cybersecurity Career Transitioner  Pentesting • GRC • SOC  Mechanical Engineering Undergrad → Biomedical Security
📍 Western Cape, South Africa (Relocating to George)
🛡 Ex‑Law Enforcement & Technical Management → Building a recruiter‑ready, hands‑on cyber portfolio

🧭 Mission
I’m methodically pivoting from law enforcement and technical management into cybersecurity, with a parallel track in mechanical/biomedical engineering. Every project, lab, and study module I complete is artefact‑driven — meaning it produces visible, recruiter‑facing proof of skill.

💻 Current Focus


📂 Featured Repositories
🔹 Pentest‑Labs – Step‑by‑step exploit walkthroughs, mitigation notes, and red/blue team perspectives.
🔹 GRC‑Toolkit – Compliance framework checklists and gap analysis templates.
🔹 SOC‑Playbooks – Simulated alerts, incident response workflows, and forensics.
🔹 Biomed‑Security‑Research – Explorations into secure design for biomedical devices.
(All repos follow a consistent folder structure, README format, and tagging for recruiter searchability.)
